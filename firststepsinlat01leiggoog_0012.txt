well, the oral practice, which I have mentioned, will he found a
valuable aud almost indispensahle aid.

My aim has been to introduce the pupil, by the aid of easy
examples, to the correct nse of words and to the chief principles of
syntax. When these examples have been studied, and the mles to
be derived from them are thoroughly understood, the exercises
that follow, both Latin and English, will be found sufficient to fix
these principles in the memory. Itis important, in fact indispen-
sable to thoroughness, ior the pupil to keep up the work of com-
position. If the exercises to be turned into Latin are too numerous,
then a part of thern can be omitted until the revlew; but some
writing in Latin should be done every day. ,

The book may seem to some teachers to be too large ior begin·
ners. But Ι have endeavored to keep in view the needs of young
pupils, and have thought it better to give too much explanation
rather than not enough. Then, again, the numerous exemplem the
explanatory notes3 the frequent illustration of Latin idioms by
reference to English3 the manner in which the paradigma are dis-
played3 and the adjustment of the type, by which the pupil can
leam not only the leading topice of the page, but also the relative
importauce of the various mleS, remarks aud observatione, have
all necessarily added to the size oi the book, but they will all, it
is hoped, he found helpful to the pupil.

My acknowledgments are due to several of our best teachers,
who have generously aided me by their counsel in the plan and in
the numerous details of the book. The entire work, while going
through the prese, has received, in addition, the valuable revision
and oversight oi Gnoson W. Cosmus, Professor of Latin in the
Coroneum nun Ponvrscnmc lssrrrurn, Brooklyn; of Casum

Uwrvnnsrrr or run Seurri, now one of the Principals of tho

many valnable suggestions in the revision oi the chapters on syntax 3.
