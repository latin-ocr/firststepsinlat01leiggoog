newly leried3 via: the loth, which'he had found in the Provinoe, the
old legions (lth, 8th, and 9th) which he had brought from Aquileia,
and the two new ones (llth and 12th) raised in Cisalpine Gaul = very
nearly 36,000 legionarias. Το these must be added 4000 cavalry, raised
in the Province and among the AEdui, and nearly 20000 auxiliaries,
making a total of 59000 or 60000. This estimate does not include the
men assigned to other duties, as working the maehines‚ taking care oi
the baggage, the army servants, etc. In the engagement Caeser did
not employ the two legions newly raised. The Helvetians had about
79000, For the time denoted by the infinitive, see ³493 discedere

was formed with the four veteran legionaris: the lth, 8th, ath, and
10th. The arrangement was such that one legion (probably the loth)
formed the right wing, two legions the cartre, and one legion the leit
wing; the legions were in the same line. This is of importante,
because the triple line oi Caesar is commonly misunderstood; if the
legion is considered as the tactical unit, there is but one line; but the
cohorts oi each legion were arranged in three lines. The celebrated
triplex acies is, then, the order of battle, according to which the ten
cohorts, oi which each legion was made up, were stationed in three
lines, one behind the other; ordinarily four heingin the frent line, three
in the second, and three in the third, a suitable space being left between
the cohorte. The arrangement of the cohorts oi the legion when in
line of battle will be understood from the following magram:—
