Oas. In the ioregoing sentence, note that the word flowing] is a
form oi the verb, but that it does not make a statement like averb.
It is used (l) as an adjective, describin river by assuming or im·
plying an action; (2) it is used as a verb, by expressing the act oi
flowing as going on at the time lte river watera lle plain. Flowinp
from tle moretoin is a anticipial phrase, modiiymg river. This
iorm ot the verb is called a participle (Lat. para, pert, and cepere,
to takep, because it partakes oi or shores the nature oi an adjective
ando averb. T e principat word oi the phrase is flowinp,· its
meaning is completed and made more distinct by the prepositional
phrase from tlte maalain. Hence the following definition :—

257. Participles in Latin, as in English, give the
meaning oi the verb in the form oi an adjective.

1. Participles are sometimes translated by the English participle
or infinitivo, and sometimes by a clause. (See 2⁵9.)
