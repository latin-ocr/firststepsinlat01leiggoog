The aim in this compendium is to mark clearly and concisely the
distinctions between synonymes used by the classical authors. These
are arranged in some two hundred lists. Each list is based on the
English word which most fully expresses the general meaning oi
words in the list. Each synonyme is printed in heavy type, to catch
the eye. These lists are arranged and numbered alphabetically, so
that the student who wishes the Latin synonymes for au English
word can find them readily. A caresully-prepared Latin index
renders it just as easy to find synonymes for the latin word. In
marking distinctions, especial use is made of derivations. Directions
are often given to prevent incorrect uscos terms by the student of
latin composition. A list of simplet synonymes is indicated (by
stars) for the use of elementary students. The hand-book will be
found invaluable in not only preparatory but also college work.
