sla Verbs used only in the third person singular, and

not admitting a definite person or thino as the subject, are
called superescat) ’

1. Impersonal Verbs are conjugated like other verbs, but are
used, for the most part, in the indicative and subjunctive, snd in
the present and the perfect infinitives, with traces of participles
and gerunds. impersoncl is only the name of a use more or less
fixed, not oi a list of verbs. Decet (³14. 2), etc, are not true irn-
pcrsonals3 their subiect is an infinitiva or a sentence used ass
noun. In the passive voice the idea of the subject must generally
be found in the verb itseli3 as, milites pugnant„ tte soldiers fiper,
becomes e militibus pignam, it is soaytt (ie. fiyhtiny is done)
by tlte soldiers.

Oss. The essence of an impersonal verbis that it has no analytic
subeat—no subject expressed or understood outside of the verb
itse f‚- whether person or ltine. The classification is purely foueat,
not lopical. fitur, tems est, ferunt„ populus lert, all mean the
same; only fitur is impersonal.
