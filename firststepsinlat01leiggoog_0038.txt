Orthia of the Romanae tanquam-With the decay
of Roman power, German tribes invaded and settled the
provinces where Latin had been spoken 3 and from the conse-
quent intcrmingling oi tongues the various modern languages
-Italian, French, Spanish‚ Portuguese, Provencah Walla-
chian, and Rhaetoitomanic (or Ronmansch)·-arose. The
English language‚ although in its origin and its most essen·
tial words a Teutonic magne, being the successor of the
Anglo·Saxon‚ has horrowed at different times nearly half its
words directly cr indirectly from the Latin.

Golden Aac of Latia—The earliest Latin writings that
have been preserved were composed about two hundred
years before Christ. The language ceased to be spoken in
the sixth century of our era. The best writers, as Caesar,
Cicero, Sallust, Vergil, Horace, and Livy, fiourished in a
period-called the Golden Age of Latin Literature-of
about one hundred years immediately preceding and follow·
ing the Christian era.
