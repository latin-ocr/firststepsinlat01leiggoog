LESSON XCVIII.
INDIREOT nlsoooasa

’ Oris. 1. Direct Discourse (hratih recta) gives the exact words of
the speaker or writer; as, Ariovistus said, “I aava cnossnn rna
Rmrvn '⁹ = Lat. Ariovistus dixit, “Rhenum transi? The words
I have crossed the Rhiae are in direct discourse; the original speaker
is represented by the narrator as speaking in the first person (bc-

cause the speaker refers to himself), and the words are given pre·
cisely as they were uttered. Indirect Discourse (oratio obliqua)
uses the same words, except that some are changed to conform to
the construction of the sentence in which they are quoted. These
changes affect only the pronouns‚ pronominal adverbs, modes, and
tenses (but not always all of these); as, Ariovistus said rrmr nn
nnn caossnn ran Rnrnn :Lat Ariovistus dixit se Rhenum
minumae. The original words I heae crossed the Rhiae, have been
changed to that he hod crossed the Rhiwe, to indicate the change of
relation in the speaker; the first person in English is changed to
the third, and the perfect tense to pluperfect‚ and, in Latin, the in-
dicative to the accusative with the infinitiva, which together form
an infinitivo substantive clause, the object of the leading verb dixit
