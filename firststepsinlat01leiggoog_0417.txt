tator, Caesar had refused to divorce his wife, as Pompey had done.
His name was then placed upon the list ot the proscribed, which
means that he could be killed by any partisan oi Sulla who happened
to see him, and his property would be confiscated, a large reward ,
being first paid to the assassin. Caesar fled at once irom the capital,
and concealed himself among the Albans hilis, until, by the interces-

sion of the vestal virgins, and many' prominent men among the ”

nobility, Sulla was indueed to grant a pardon. “You wish it‚’' said
Sulla, “and I grant it ς but in this boy there are more than one Marius.''
Caesar, however, would not accept pardon, and so long as Sulla lived,
he avoided the capital. While in Asia Minor, he distinguished him-
self at the siege of Mytilene (or Mitylene), winning the civic crown ior
saving the life of a citizen. When the news ol Sulla's death reached
him, he returned'to Rome; hut, seeing that there was no prospect at
present of the popular party regaining power, he deeided to withdraw
again from the capital, and to devote himself at Rhodes to the study
of oratory, in which he had already gained some renown. On his
way thither he was captured by pirates, with whom the Mediterranean
Sea at that time swarmed, because the govemment at home had been
ior many years so inefflcient and lax. The pirates demanded twenty
talents—nearly twenty-five thousand dollars -for his ransom. “ It is
too little,'' said Caesar; “you shall have fifty; but once free, I will ,
crucify you.'’ And he kept his word; for no sooner had he gained his
liberty than he manned some vessels, overpowered the pirates, and
conducted them to a neighhoring city as prisoners.

On his return to Rome, Caesar used every means to increase his
popularity. His affable manners, and still more his unbounded liber-
ality‚ won the hearts of the people. At the ageos thirty-five (assuming
the earlier date) he was 'Quaestor in Further Spain (ac. 68). Two years
later (no. 65) he was Curule AEdile, an office which gave him a good
opportunity to win the favor of the people‚ because hc was to have
charge of the public games and exhibitione. As AEdile, Caesar not
only embellished the lorum and public buildings, and exhibited three
hundred and twenty pairs of gladiators equipped in silver, but in all
the diversione oi the theatra, in the processions and public tables, he
lar outshone the most ambitious of his predecessors. His prodi·
gality was frightsul, his debts enormous, amounting at this time to
more than one hundred million sesterces-nearly five million dol·
lars. When the chief pontifi died (nc. 63), the most illustrious men
of the state sought the office. Caesar, however, did not give way to
them, although Catulus, one ot liis opponents, who had been Consul,
