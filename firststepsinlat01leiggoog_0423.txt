in great numbers to Gaul, and disseminated Roman culture and
civilization to sneh an extent that many of the tribes could transact
business with Roman ambassadors in the Latin language. The eentre
of this civilization and refinement was the old Greek city Massilia;
also the resort oi those who had been banished frorn the capital. The
merchants stationed there carried on an extensive trade with the inte·
rior of Gaul, anderen with Britain. They transported their wares up
the Rhone and Saone, and thence by land to the Scine and Loire, or
across to the Garonna and so to the Atlantia. This intercourse pro-
duced a close connection between the tribes from the Rhone and the
Garonne to tha Rhine and the Themes. Caesar saw how essential tha
possession oi this country was to the Roman state, and that to its con·
queror was offered the prospect of surpassing the farne of Camillus
and Marius. ,

ot the population of Gaul, the AEdni had entered into an alliance
with Rome, while the Belgae in the north, and the Sequani in the

the assistance of Rome, imposed heavy tolls on the navigation of the
Saone. The Sequani complained bitterly of this, and thinking that
the Roman govemment was too much occupied with its own conten-

chief magistrate oi his elan, alone refused to sign the treaty,.and fied
to Rome to ask assistance. Ariovistus now invited other tribes across
the Rhine, and demanded land to settle them on3 the whole frontier of
Gaul, irem the sources of the Rhine to the ocean, was threatened by
the invasion of the German tribes. These tribes so pressed upon the
llelvetians, who were henrnred in on the south and the west by the Alps,
Lake Geneva, and the J ura Monntains‚ that they determined to aban-
don their country to the Germane, and seek larger and more fertile
flelds in the west. Caesar, on the expiration oi his consulship, had
remained in tha vicinity of the capital until he accomplished his politi-

abandoned their homes, and were advaneing upon Geneva with the
purpose of crossing the Rhone and forcing their way through the
Province, he hastily made his preparatione, reached the Rhone in
eight days, and by skiliul negotiatione dalayed the advance until a
