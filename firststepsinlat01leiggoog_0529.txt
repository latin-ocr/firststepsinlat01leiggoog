elaborate pians of the most important battles and siegeS, and a

double-page colored map oi Gaul, revised according to the most

The vocabulary attempts to give, first, the etymological mean-
ing of each word so iar as is possible; second, the general meanings
of the words, representing the conceptions as they appeared to the

case, so far as it is known, is shown, and all the elements which
have entered into the formation are noted.

of Nipperdey, the more important various readings being given in
the notes. References are given to the Grammars of Allen dr
Greenough, Gildersleeve, and Harkness.
