PERSON.

If we change the subject in the first sentence tollore. 01·tolre‚
we must then change the verb strlle to strilesr, or to slrllcr. These
changes are made ior the sake of opreemene between the subject
and the verb-the verb ending in esc agrees with thou in the
second person, and the verb ending in -s agrees with le in the third
person. Both of these subjecte are singular number; ii the sub
jech is plural, the verb must be plura13 aa tle men sollae. Hence,
verbs agree with their subjecte in number and person.

4. Nnmber and Person of averb are those modificatione
which show its agreement with the number and person of

the subject, as, The bap runs. The boys run.
