and was now a prominent member of the senate, fearing to bc defeated
by one so much inferior in rank, station, and age, offered Caesar large
sums of money to pay his debts, if he would withdraw from the con-
test. On the morning of the election, Caesaris reported to have said
to his mother, who would gladly have had him withdraw from the
struggle, “I shall this day be either chief pontiff or an exilc.”

The next year Caesar was Praetor, and as Propraetor he went, at
the end of his year of office, to govern Spain. Before his departure,
his old friend Crassus, the richest man at Rome, had to pay a part of
his debts, and to stand security for the rest to the amount of nearly a
million of dullars. Caesar is reported to have said in his reckless way
that he needed a hundred million sesterces to be worth just nothing at
all. In Spain he displayed that civil and military ability which after-
wards made him famous. It must have been a strange sight to see
this dissolute spendthrift, this profligate demagogue, with his counte
nance pale and white, withered before its time by the excesses of the
capital, this delicate and epileptic man, wallring at the head of his
legions, and fighting as the foremost soldier with the wild tribes of
Lusitania. v

On his return to Rome, Caesar found Pompey, who had just com·
pleted the Mithridatio war in the Rast, and was arranging for his
triumphal entry into the city, at variance with the senate. Caesar at
once saw his opportunity ; he formed a political coalition with Pompey
and Crassus, one part of the bargain being that Caesar should have
the consulship for the next year (nc. 59), and after that the govern-
ment of Gaul for flvc years. In accordance with this programma,
Caesar was entrusted, at the expiration of his consulship, with the
command of Cisalpine Gaul, Illyricum, and thc province of Narbo,
or simply mortaria, with three legions, for a term of five years.
Casas had now attalned his object. As Proconsul of Cisalpine Gaul,
he could watch the progress of affairs in the capital, while the threat-
ening movements of the tribes in Gaul opened to him the prospect of
subjugating thc country and training an army for the impending civil
war, for Caesar no doubt then clearly saw that a struggle between hinr-
self and Pompey for the chief power at Rome was inevitablc.

For a long time the Romans had felt the inrportance of possessing
Gaul, but as yet no systematic effort had been made to extend their
dominion in that quarter farther than occnpying the seaboard between
the Alps and Pyrenees (nc. 121). The climate of Gaul was health·
ful, the soil rich and fertile, and the intercourse with Rome easy by
land and sea. Roman merchants and farmers had already emigrated
