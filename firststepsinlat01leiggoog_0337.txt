by dc si, at et, namnet, quast, tanquam, tanquam ei,

not observed, but the rule for conditional sentences prevails. In
the first example the present sub'unctive is used in the com arative
clause, though the unreality oi the comparison is impliedbecause
the leading verb is in the present tense; hence,
