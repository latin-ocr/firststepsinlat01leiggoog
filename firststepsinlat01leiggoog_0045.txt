LESSON Ill.

SYLLABIOATION.

25 A Latin word is divided into as many syllables
as it has vowels or diphthongs.

Ona. The English words mile, accurate, separate, chale, would,
as Latin words, be syllabicated as follows: ml-le, acen-rastte,
sepa-rrae, a-ba'te.

26. A single consonant between two vowels is joined

to the second vowel.

EXAMPLES.
l. lit-ber. artisau. 3. &gl-na, queen.
2. lau‘do, I prone. 4. domi-nus, lcrd.

27. When the consonant is ‹lonbled, the first belongs
to the first syllable, and the second to the second
syllable.

EXAMPLES.
1. austum, year. 3. pen'-na,seolher.

2. bel-lum, war. l. mit'-t0‚ Isencl.

za Two or more consonants not doubled between two
vowels belong to the· following vowel, but l, m, a, r, in
connection with another consonant, are joined to the

preceding vowel.
