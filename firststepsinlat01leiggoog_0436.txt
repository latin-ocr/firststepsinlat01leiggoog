The following brilliant description 01 the battle near Bibracte is from
Mommsen's History 01 Rome (vol. iv. p. 253, Eng. edi: “The two
armies posted themselves on two parallel chains 01 hills ς the Celts
began the engagement, broke the Roman cavalry which advanced into
the plain, and ran onward against the Roman legions posted on the
slope 01 the 11111, but were there obliged to give way before Caesar’s
veterana. When the Romans, thereupon following up their advantage,
descended in their turn to the plain,'the Celts again advanced against
them, and a reserved Celtic corps took them at the same time in the
fiank. The reserve 01 1110 Roman attacking column was pushed forward
against the latter ; it forced it away from the main body upon the bag·
gage and the barricade 01 wagons, where it was destroyed. The bulk
01 the Helvetic host was at length brought to give way, and compelled
to beat a retreat in an easterly direction, —the opposite 01 that towards
which their expedition led them. This day had frustrated the scheme 01
the Helvetii to establish lor themselves new settlements on the Atlantia
Ocean, and handed them over 10 the pleasure 01 1110 vietor3 but it had
been ahot day also for the conquerors.'’
