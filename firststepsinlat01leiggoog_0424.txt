lineos entrenchments had been constructed from Lake Genera to the
Jura Mountains. Defeated in the attempt to eross the river in this
direction, the Helvetii were compelled to take their way along its

right bank, and thus make their joumey westward bya more north·
erly route. Caesar hastily collected his forces, followed up the left
bank of the Saone, cut to pisces in a flerce battle a part of the Helve-
tian army, and pursued the remainder to Bibracte, where he defeated
them in aterrible battle, and compelled the survivors to return to their
native country and rehuild their homes.

1. Gallia: Gaul extended from the Pyrenees and the Gulf of Lyons
on the south to the British Channel and German Ocean on the north.
lt was bounded on the west by the Atlantia Ocean, and on the east by
the Rhine and Italy. lt was called Transalpina (ie. beyond tte Alps),
to distinguish it from Cisalpina (ie. on this side os the Alps), in north·
ern Italy. lt included France, Belgium, part of Switzerland and Hol-
land, and the part of Germany west of the Rhine. ln the division

. which Caesar here makes he does not include the southeast part, called
Gallia Narbonensis, or commonly Prbvincia, whence the modern name
Provence. The Roman dominion in the Prbvinoia was secured by the
establishment of Narbo Marcius, a Roman colony on the Atax, in
a.c.121.

The most remote Roman towns towards the west and north were Lug-
dunum, Convenarum (or Convenae), Tolosa, Vienna, and Geneva. The
country was well provided with roads and bridges. The commerce on
the Rhone, Garunna, Loire, and Seine was considerable and lucrative,
and extended even into Britain. The people were tall, of fair complexion

, and of sanguine temperament, fond of fighting, but easily discouraged.
They were skilled in working copper and gold. Copperimplements oi
excellent workmanship, and even now malleable, have been found in the

ι tombs in many places in Gaul. The Romans are said to have learned

. from them the artos tinning and silvering. The Gauls, or as they
called themselves the celte, had attained so much skill in mining,

' that the minere, especially in the iron-mines on the Loire, acted an im·
portant part in sieges. There was no political union among the different
clane, no leading canton for all Gaul, no tie, however loose, uniting the
whole nation under one leadership. Sometimes one canton would ex·
tend its power over aweaker one, as the Suessiones in the north, the
maritime cantoris in the west, the two leagues in the south, one headed
hythe AEdui, the other hythe Sequani; but the Celts asa nation lacked
politioal unity, and the cantoris, ior the most part, existed independently
