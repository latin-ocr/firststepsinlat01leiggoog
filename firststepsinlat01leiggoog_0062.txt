LESSON XI.

term Nodos.
ιΝειεοτιοΝ.

59. The meaning of Latin nouos is altered by In·

flecti0113 that is, by changing the form of the word,

2 generally the endings, to denote some modification of

its meaning, or to show its relation to other words.

The Indoction of nouns, of pronouns, and of adjectiveS,

is called Declencioa. The Infleotion of verbs is called
Conjngotion.

Stant aad Saffioe.

60. The body of the word, to which the sufflx is attached,
is called the stem ; as,

militis: millt- is the stem, and dn the termination,

-When the stem ends in a vowel and the snfflx begins with
s a vowel, contraction ta'kes place, and the final vowel of the
stem sometimes disappears3 as,

· x mensae: the stem inmenso, and the suffixa-s, which unite
to form mensae, the s being dropped.

1. Each case-form, therefore, contains two distinct parts:
the etant, which gives the general meaning oi the word3 and
the cose-soffia, which shows the relation oi that meaning to
some other word3 as, in

militie, of a soldier: the general idea, soldier, is expressed by
the stem mss1t3 'the relation os, by the suffix 4²!-

Ons. It may be found convenient to divide inflected words not
only into stem and tetminatinn, bnt into bose. and termination, the
base1 being the part of the word that remains unchanged by inflec-
tion; as, servus (which stands for servos), a slave, gen. servi, os
α clave. eervd· is the stem, -ῐ is the termination, or casesuffix:
thecis dropped before 1 to form servi, of a slave ; but serv, tn
which the case-endings are added, renrains anchanged by inflection,
and may be called the base.
