a. A Relatire Clausa, even in Indirect Discourse, may
take the indicative, if it contains a statement on the authority
of the narrator (=tlre present speaker or writer), or it it
is a mere circumlocution.

EXAMPLES.

1. Caesar per exploratores certior factus est, ex ea parte
vici quam Gallis concesserat, omnes nocta discessisse,
Coesar tuas informed through ln's sconts thot nd of them bad

2. quis neget haec omnia quae videmus deorum pbtestate
administrari, tulto would deny that dn whole visible worldis
managed oy tlte power of tlte gods?

Ous. The statement on the authority of the present speaker or
writer is equivalent to saying that the statement is a fact,· hence,
the indicative is used. The relative clause quam . . . concesse-
rat, although standing iu Indirect Discourse, is in the indicative,
because it is an explanation given by the writer himself (Caesar).
T he relative clause quae videmus, ma be considered as explana
tory (ie. it is a circtnnloention), and although introduced into the
Indirect Discourse, the verb (videmus) is iu the indicative, because
the manner of making the assertion is not important enough to rise
into consideration; hence, the verb remains in the mode in which
it would naturally be, viz. the indicative. The statement is virtu-
ally made on the authority of the present speaker, because he does
not think it worth while to shift thc responsibility3 ie. it often
depends merely upon the feeling of the writer whether he will use

the indicative or subjunctive.

clause which is itsetf subordinate. When the first subordinate clause
is a subjunctive (or an infinitive) clause, then the subjunctive is

may be in the indicative, but, if the clause (intermediate) is in
Indirect Discourse, its verb is naturally iu the subjunctive (as in
the foregoiug lesson), unless the clause is merely explanatory, ie. a
