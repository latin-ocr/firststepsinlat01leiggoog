One. 1. The perfect infinitive represents in Indirect Discourse
the perfect, the aorist, the plaperfect, and the imperfect indicative.
When the leading verb is 1n the future, the infinitive expresses a
double relation,— (1) το the time of assertiug, and (2) to the time
of the aetion asserted3 as, dicet se scribite, ire will sap (1) ttot te
is now writinp, (2) thot lie is ‘risun writinp‚ ie. at the time af saying.
The future infinitive can be formed only from verbs that havea

perfect passive participle. The want of it is supplied hythe nse

af the uture infinitive of sum (ihre or fiftsnum esse) with a
consecutive clause. This periphrase sometimes occurs when the
regular forms might be used.

Ons. 2. In Indirect Discourse, nate that the present infinitive
stands far the present indicative (or sometimes for the imperfect,
especially after m6m1n1); and that the perfect infinitive stands
for any post tense oi the indicative.

One. 3. With verbs of hopinp, promisinp, threateninp, and the
like, the Latin idiom differs from the English in requiring the suh
ject to be (usually) expressed3 as, eperat se scriptarum esse, lte

hopes tc write (lit. dolopes that lte will write).
