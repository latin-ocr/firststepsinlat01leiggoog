ie. a primary tense in the leading clause is followed by a primary
tense in the subordinate clause, and that esecondary‚ora11his-
torical, tense in the leading clause is followed by a secondary, or
an historical, tense iu the subordinate clause. The rule is called
the rule for the Secusses: or Turnus, aud is, in general, the same
in Latin as iu En lish. For those dependent sentences that require
the subjunctive, tlre rule may be stated as follows:—

SEQUENCE OF TENSES.

319. RUIAE XLVII. -A primary tense in the lead-
ing clause is followed by a primary tense in the
dependent clause3 and a secondary tense is followed

Ἴ by a secondary.

Ons. The rules for the Sequence of Tenses are not applicable to
indicative clauses (te. to clauses that have their verbs in the in-
dicative), nor to conditional sentences (regardless of mode). For
these, special rules are necessary (see ³25).

320. The Sequencc of Tenses may be represented as
follows:—

The Present Sutjunclive, for

j incomplete action. .

Secondary Tenses: The Imperfect Subjunotive,
Imperfect‚ for incomplete action.

Acrist (Perfeci), 1 are f⁰H⁰WEd by ἱ The Pluperfect Subjunctire,

Ons. ln the following examples‚ note that the tense of the sub
junctive is always dated at the same time as the tense of the leading
verb, r'.e. the tense of the Latin subjunctive is the sameas the
tense of the indicative or potential in the English sentence. The
commonest tenses of the subjunctive in dependent clauses are the
present and imperfect, the latter being used in such dependent
clauses for the English aorist as well as for the real imperfect.
