HE aim cithia book is ιο furnish pupils who have given little
or nc attention to the study oi English grammar c complete
course ia Latin sor oue year.

The book opens with a short and easy review oi English gram-

mar. In the lessons, the changes in the forms, uses, and relations
of words ara explained and illustrated, so iar as is practicable,
from English, before introducing the Latin forms and construc-
tions. In order to avoid or to lessen the bewilderment usually
produced in :the mind of the young beginner by the use oi a
complete Latin grammar, everything not essential to the structure
cf a simpla sentence has, at first, been careiully excluded. In
short, no effort has been spared ιο smooth the way ior the
beginner‚ and ιο prepare him ior the intelligent reading of Caesar
or of any oi the less difficult Latin authors.

Much care and study have been expended 011 the order and
arrangement oi the lessous, especially in the earlier part, aiming
mainly at two things: First, to introduce very early in the course
the simpla verhforms, which are easier than the nouus and open
the way ιο a wide range oi expression3 and, secondly, ιο give not

bare words and their inflections, but sentences from tle stari, with -

,both questions and answers, in natural aud easy succession. The
vocabularies at the head ol each lesson and the exercises for trans·
lation, both Latin and English, will aliord abundant material for
drill on the forins. The teacher, however, will find itan excellent
oral exercise to combine these words into new sentences (both
Latin and English), requiring the pupil to give the translation.
*The first associatione with any language, especially when learned
by the young, should he such as to make itas nearly as possible a
living tongue; the scientific study of it should follow, not go

before, some elementary knowledge ot what it is in actualspeech.
Ido not wish to be understood as advocating the neglect oi syntax
