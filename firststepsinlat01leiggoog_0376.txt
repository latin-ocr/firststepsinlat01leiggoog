oi the speaker or narrator himself may take this construction. On
this principle, indirect questions and dependent constructione fol-

lowing verbs of wisbiay, desit-iay, ete, as well as final clauses, may
be explained es Indirect Discourse, the indireci relation often being
confined to a dependent clause, aad not extending to the whole
sentence, as, nova nupta flet quod ire necesse sit, tte bride is
receptaq because she mast 90 (says sbe). This sentence in indirect
Discourse is: nova nupta dicit se flere quod ire necesse sit
Hence-

INFORMAL INDIRECT DISCOURSE.

364. RULE LXIX.- A relative or other subordinate
clause may take the subjunctive when it expressae,
though not in formal indirect discourse, the thought
af some other person than the speaker or writer.

EXAMPLES.

“ 1. omnes libres quos irater suus reliquisset mihi adnavit,
be qaae to me att tte books abicb (as be said) bis brctber bad test.
2. secretas accfisitua est quod corrumperet juventatem,
Ἰ Socrates aas arraiyaed because (as was alleged) be corrupted
tbe youth.
3. Aedui questi sunt quod Harddes fines ebrum pbpdli-
rentur, tbe AEdai eoraptaiaed because (as tbey said) rte
Harudes scere layinq waste their territory.

Oas. 1. The constructione following verbs oi wishing, etesiaca,
cunctamina, penrrittiap, carinq, striainq, binderia , feariaq, aad the
like, may be explained as informal Indirect biscourse (usually
called petitio obliqua).

EXAMPLES.

1. nihil indignius est quam eum qui eulpa careat supplicia
nr'rn carere, nothing r's more unbecomiap tbaa ibat beabo is
free from fault sboald aot be free from punishment.

2. milites misit, ut eos qui iflgbrant persequerentur, be seut
soldiers to (aba should) parrae tbose aba bad fled (ie. tbe

fugitives).

Ons. 2. Note, in the foregoing examples, that the relative clause
qui careat (see ³61), depending on an infinitive, has its verb in
the subjunctive by the ordinary rule3 in Ex. 2, the clause qui
ingerant has its verb in the indicative, because it is regarded as
parenthetical, ie. it is a circumlocution (see ³62. a).
