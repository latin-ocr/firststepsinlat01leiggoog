249. It may now be taken ior granted that the pupil has become
familiar with the inflectional endings‚ the general order of words
in a Latin sentence (111), and the principal rules ol syntax. He
has, also, learned many words, mostly selected from the First Book
ol Caesar, and it is now time lor him to try tc unravel the dis·
ficulties oi an ordinary Latin sentence.

'1. In the first place, the pupil should pronounce the Latin eare-
fully and slowly, noticing the endings ol each word, in order to
determine which words are nouns and which verbs, etc.

determine its number and meaaiap. Sometimes the subject isnot
expressed, but is contained in the ending ot the verb. It can be
found by noticing the person and number ol the verb, as it must
be a pronoen oi the person indicated by' the verb.

3. Next find the Pnrnrcarn, and translate it, notieing carefully
