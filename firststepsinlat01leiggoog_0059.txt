FIRST GONJ UGATION.

Nouus AND QUEs'nons.

1. The endings were originally personal pronouns: laudas means
not love, but thou lovest. The pronoun‚ when used as the subject of the
verb, need not, therefore, be expressed. Note, further, thet the endings
show the number and person of the subject, but not the gender.

Ores. This is true, in general, only when tlre verb is of the first or
second person. With the third person, n definite subject should be ex·
pressei, unless implied in what precedes or follows.

2. Note that the Present Indicative :present stent ÷ personal end·
' ings, and that 511154- o = dmm also, that it hes lost the nr (which
appears in sum, inquam). The o stands for m and the preceding
vowel; as, imo = {ma-om

3. Read, Ι proies, etc.

4. The stem is laudi, and by adding the personsl ending we get
lauda-0, which is eontracted into laudo.

5. Remember thot the present tense in English hes three forms: —

1. laudo, I praz'se, Ι am pror'er'nq, Ι do proise.
2. laudas, tlon praisest, tlon ort proidny, tlon dost preire.

3. laudat„ de prar‘ses, lte is prot'st'ny, le does pruine.

6. Observe thet no separate Latin word is required for the pronouns
1, thou, lte, we, they, etc.; thus, pugnamus, we figit, contains the pro·
noun we, end is a complete sentence in one word, ie. contains a subject

and predicate ; ee,
pugna-mus

figit-we

pugne, signifying fiplrt, is the stem, end mue, signifying wc, the
personal ending.
