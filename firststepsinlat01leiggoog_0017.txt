Ossuavaraow. In the study of English grammar, one of the
first things the pupil has to do is to classiiy and name the various
words that he meets in his exercises. lle does this in the same
manner that oue might pick out, sort, and group objects of any
kind: viz, by noting the points in which they resemble one an-
other. For example, we may, from certain resemblances in form
and structure, select all trees of a certain kind, and call them
litisattalasithilia ltlltlhtl atttriti
study each hians, as the out, and leam all that is perhaps necessat}
to know of the numerous individuals that compose the class. In
the same manner, we may study and classify words. Noticing the

* various ways the different words are used in sentences, we sort

them out, or roup them, into eight classes, which are called Panas
or spanos. hose words that name obJ'ects are called Nouus, from
the Latin word nomen, which means α name. But we soon learn
that we cannot talk or say an hing about the noun without using
another kind of word, calle Vunn, from the Latin verbum, a
word. When a noun and a verb are combined so as to express a
thpughthiae. so as to make sense, then a sentence (Lat. sententia)

PRONOUNS.

Charias went to Rome wira his molter, aad lie came back without
ter. In this sentence we make use oi three little words, called
Pnonouus. They are tis, te, and ter. Without these words, we
should be compelled to repeat the nonna, and to say: Charias went
to Rome uiti Chorlea‘s molter, und Clarles came back 'wdtom
Clarlar's molter.
