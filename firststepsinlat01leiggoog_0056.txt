Ons. The pupil will notice that the infinitive in Latin is formed
not as in English, by placing the proposition to before the simple
form of the verb, but b adding re. Each ofthese verbenas, also,
a characteristic vowel iiefore the infinitivo ending, which in imo
is o, in moneo is o, in rogo is ai, and in audio is -ῑ-.

55. Accordingly, Latin verbs are divided into four
classes called Conjnyotiona, distinguished from one an-
other by the characteristic vowel before the ending -νε

1. The vowel before oe is called the stein-chorocteristic;
thus, the stem of verbs of the first conjugation ends in ᾶ,
the second in e, the third in ἑ, the fourth in i.

2. Besides the present stem, there is often asimpler form
that forms thebaeis of the entire conjugation, called the
verb-slent. In the first, second, and fourth conjugations
the verb-stem is generally the same as the present stem; in
the third coujugation rep· is the verb-stem, and ripe- the
present stem; as,
