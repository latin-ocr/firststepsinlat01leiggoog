The notes are designed to give not only what may serve the
learner in the bare understanding of the text, but, along with it,
some hint of that wealth of traditional interpretation which is more
important, perhaps, in the study of Virgil than in that of any other
ancient poet.

The many woodcuts, taken from ancient objects of art, will serve

to illustrate the poet’s conception better than annotations alone
could do.
. In preparing the Vocabulary to accompany his Virgil, or for use

with other editionS, the author has had two things in view: first, to t

supply as much information as was possible in regard to the history
and uses of the Latin words, so that the book should not be amere
key to translate by, but should also furnish means for the study os
the language itself3 and, secondly, at the same time to give or sug·
gest a snitable English expression for every passage.

The actual quantity of vowels, where known, has been indicated,
irrespective of syllabic quantity, in order to aid the proper pronun·
ciation of Latin words
