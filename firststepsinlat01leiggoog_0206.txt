m A clause is a part oi a sentence containing a
subject and predicate.

One. The clause, uto is cautious, really periorms the office oi an
adjective, as we may use in place of it simply the word cautious,
and say tte cautious uenerat uttt succeed. The adjective clause,
eolo is cautious, performing the office oi a single word, is called a
Deenunenr Gentem the other clause, tle uenerat will succeed, not
performing the office oi a single word, is called an Inserennnn'r
Censen. The two clauses, connected by uto, are so combined that
one modifies the other; they form in combination a Conernx
Senrencn. In the second sentence, tte floods came is the indepen-
dent clause, modified by the clause euleu tle rain descended, te. by
a clause telling colcu the floods came3 and as this clause periorms
the office of a sin le word, aa adverb, the two clauses in combina-
tion form a Compdex Sentence.

m. A Compound Sentenoe is compcsed of two or
more independent clauses.
