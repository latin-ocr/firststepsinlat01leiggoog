PREFACE. V

-um, called by many grammarians one of the principat parts of the
verb, belongs, 1111001, to only about 250 Latin verbs; then, again,
·those verbs that are invariably intransitive have the perfect parti-
ciple iu the neuter gender only. This part, then, called in tho
dictionaries the supine in -urn, must, in most cases, be the neuter of
the perfect participle3 and I have ventured, in the enumeration of
the principa] parts of the verb, to give it this name, and also to
substitute, as Venicek and other grammarians have done, in place
of supine stem, the more correct 101111 participio! stem. The retention
of the nemer of 1110 perfect participle, in enurnerating the principa]
parts of the verb, instead of the masculine, is of importance from
the fact just mentioned in regard to intransitive verbs, and also ,
because it can be made to conform easily to the present usage of
our dictionaries.

The words in 1110 short vocabularies at 1110 beginning of the
lessons‚ as well as the examples to illustrate the rules of syntax,
010 mostly drawn from the first five chapters of Caesar's Gallie
War. These vocabularies should be thoroughly committed to
memory. The practice of selecting examples from authors of
different periods and modes oi expression tends, as it seems 10 me,
rather to perplex young pupils than to give them definite ideas of
the structure and formation of a Latin sentence. No effort- is
made 111 these vocabularies to teach the derivatiou of words3 but, in
the general vocabulary at the close of the book, the prefixes, 0101110,
and endings of the words have been carefully indicated. In the
chapter on the formation of words, attention is mainly confined to
the formation of those words that the pupil can easily under-
stand, and that can be made of service to him while studying these
Iessons.

Exercises for sight-reading have been introduced early in the
course. The lesson read at sight can be assigned as 1110 regular
lesson of the next day, and made 10 serve as the basis for addi-

tional drill in syntax aad etymology. On the third day, 1110 pupil
should be required to translate the same 1000011, as a review exer-
cise‚ into clear aud accurate English, absolutely disregarding the
literal construction of the words and sentences. These exercises
will also aflord ample means for practice in pronouncing Latin,
which is best acquired in reading connected sentences as is the
case in a modern language. But in order to read Latin easily and
