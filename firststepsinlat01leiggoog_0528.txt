The publication of the new Caesar was the third step toward the
perfecting of a series which, even in its first draft, was received by
eminent authorities as marking a new era in the study of Latin;
and‚-like the first two stepS‚ —the new grammar (revised in 1877),
and Greenough's Virgil (issued in 1881)‚—it has been most cor-

below will indicate.

The prime object of this edition is to help the student with each
sentence, to put before his mind the same picture which that sen-

The Commentaries are simply a military history, —a story of
battle and siege. Hence it is clear that to read the book under-

army and its methods. So that while the annotation has been
most faithfully done in all respects, special care has been taken
with the military notes contributed by Professor Judson.

It is attempted to give, in the light of the latest scholarship, a
picture of the Roman soldier of Caesar‚-—his dres8‚ his arms, his
food. We study the tactics of the legionS‚ and see their evolutions
