The standing 01 this Grammar is now so well established that no
extended comments ordescription need be given.

1. It has been used and recommended by teachers 01 Latin every·
where,-particularly in the large and in the distinctively classical
' 30110013, where an independent judgment might be expected.

2. Its firmest friends are those who have used it lougest. ’

3. The clearness‚ simplicity, conciseness‚ convenience 01 size and
arrangement, and economy 01 matter, essential in a class-room man·
ual, have been secured without sacrifice 01 rigid scholarship‚ as is
shown by the emphatic endorsements 01 eminent authorities.

4. To place before the public in authentic form the exact status¹
01 the question, the publishers print a series 01 testimonials from
prominent professors and teacherS, representing 132 colleges and
452 schools. The latter include about 72‚ooo students. These
1011013, which have a judicial value as the independent judgments 01
competent and disinterested men, pronounce the grammar

“Especially suited to beginners.” “ Brief and concise.''

“ Broad, comprehensive, and complete.'' ‘⁶ Simple and clear.”
“ Thorough‚ accurate, and scholarly.''

“ systematis, scientific‚ and philosophical.”

“ Practical‚ and satisfactory to teachers and to students.''

¹* 'l'he best extant.” [Send for tlte circulor]

At the present time, inasmuch as the grammar has no longer
against it the natural conservatism 01 the 30110013, and the no less
natural prejudice of an entire corps 01 teachers trained in the methods
01 other books, its continued and increased success is not surprising.
