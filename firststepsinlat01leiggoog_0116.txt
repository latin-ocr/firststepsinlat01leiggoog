Eae note that the descriptive noun filia stands in thesaure part
of the sentence as the subject which it modifies; it is called au
appositive. In Eae the descriptive noun is used to form the
· predicate, and is called a predicate novo, or complentem. Note that
the predicate adjective agrees with its noun in ponder, eaproter, and
cese, the predicate noun agrees with the subject in cese. Note
the position of the predicate adjective3 it nray, however, precede
the verb for the sake of emphasis. Iu Ex. 5 the verb sum helps

verb. lt is an auxiliary verb when it helps to form some of
the tenses oi other verbs; it is copulative when it joins the
subJect to some other word which is used tc describe the
subject. The word thus used to describe the subject may be
a noun or an adjective, and is called the complentem. If the
descriptive word is a noun, it is called a predicate aova; if
it is an adjective, then it is called a predicate adjective.

noen, and denoting the same person cr thing, is put in the same
case. When the descriptive noun is in the same part of the sen·
tence, it is called an Arrosrrrvn3 and when it stands in the predicate,
usually after intransitive verbs oi to be, to become, to veracia, etc,

and with passive verbs of norninp, cvdinp, ctovsinp, cppcicticq, eta,
it is called a Pnnorcnrn Nonruewvn.
