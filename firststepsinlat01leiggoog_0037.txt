κῆον--

ortatu of Latara—The Latin langnagc was spoken at
Rome and in thc adjoining district, the plain of Latium, from
which latter it derives its narne. It is closely related to the
tongues spoken by the Samnites, Sabinos. and other klndred
raceS, to which the general name ol Suhcllr'ou has been
given. These Sabellian tribes, on first euteriug Italy, settled
along the mountain ridges, from which they descended to the
plains like streams that fiood and fertilizc the valleys. The
Latius, who settled near the Tiber, belonged to the oldest
of these successive niigrations3 then came the Sabines, the

. Aequians, HemicanS, and Volscians, who at first pressed

hard on the Latius, and hemmed them into the narrow plain
i between the Tiber and the Alban hilis, but iu course of time
coalesced with them aud formed one nation.

How Relatcd.-The Latin, aa well as the Greek, San·
skrit, Teutonic, Celtic, and Zend, are all sister languages,

. and together help tu surm the ludo-European family. The

original language from which these sprang was spoken by

¹ the progenitore oi all these peoples, who once lived together·
l somewhcre in Central Asia, and by successive migratione
¹ peopled India and Europe, whence the name Indo-Europeau.

The name Aryan (prouounced (ir-you) is often applied to
this parent language, and to the groups that have descended
from it.

Where spoaea.-Theoonq11esrs of the Romans caused
the Latin langnage to spread, not only over Italy and Sicily,

‘.‚- but over the greater part of France and Spain.
