³17. Primary and Secondary Tenses

Oss. We hare learned that tense denotes the time of the action3
and as time admits ot a threefold division, into present, post, and
soture, there must be at least three tenses to represent an action in
present, past, or future time. But in each ot these tenses an action
may be represented as incomplete or as compleuit, and irorn these
two divisione arise six tenses ot the Latin verb; viz. :-

1. The Present, denoting incomplete action in the present.
2. The Future, denoting incompleta action in the future.
3. The Irnperfect, denoting incomptete action in the past.
4. The Perfert, denoting completed action in the present.
5. The Fut. Peri, denoting completed action in the future.

6. The Pluperfect denoting completed action in the past.

Each of these tenses also represents the action either as in prog-
ress (still unfinished) or at the close ot its progress (ie. as

now finishedpl. An action may further be represented as being
simply broug t to pass, without reference to its being continuone
or rnomentary, complete or incompleta This distinction gives rise
to the indefinite or coristic stage of action, which has no separate
tense form. It is expressed by the present tense tor the present, by
the future ior the future, and by the corint (perfect definite) tor the
past. The following table will show these temporal relations :—
