Adverba.

Ona. A noun and a verb are both necessary in order to form a
sentence. We have learned that modifying words are often added
to nonna to explain or to express the idea more clearly. Words are
often added to the verb for the same purpose. Ii we say, tlte bey
reads, we express the fact in a general way3 but, il we wish to
speak of the marmer of reading, then we say, tlte lep reaat badi ,
adding the vvord badlvffi if, of the time, we add the word now: tlte

bey reads notra· of the place, we add the word ltere: tte bey read
ltere. We may jein words to these modifiem, and say, tlte bey reads
very badly, that is, very modilies badly5 vve may jein avvord to an
adjective, as, that boolr is very qood. These words that we jein
vvith verbs, adjectivae, or arlaerbs, to modily their meaning, are called
Anvsnns (Lat. ad, to, and verbum, a word, or verb).

15. An Adverb is a word used to modify verba, adjectivae, or
adverba; aa, he speaks plainly ,· a 'is Q aoid
