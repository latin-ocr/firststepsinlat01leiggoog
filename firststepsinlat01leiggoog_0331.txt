0110. 010 01 the most obvious classifications 01 conditional sen· ,

tences 10 that 01 (1) present, (2) pust, and (3) soture conditions, the
distinction being based on the time 10 which the condition refers.
The pupil‚ however, should note that in Ex. 1 01 the third set, the
imperfect denotes present time. We may, 01 the other hand,
classify conditional sentences 00 10 their meaning, 10. 00 10 what
is implied with regard 10 the fulfilment 01 the condition. In the
first two examples, no opinion is expressed or implied as 10 the
10011 01 the supposition, 10. 00 to lis tooiny money,· but what is
stated as 01001 10 this: granted the supposition, 10. 110110 los
money, and the conclusion must follow, 10. teyioes it. In Latin
any present 0r past tense 01 the indicative may be used either in
the condition or conclusion. If a past tense is used in this form
01 conditional sentences, the upil must take care not to conlound
such sentences with those in 110 third set. Observe the distinction
between if 10 lod money, 10 yooe 11, and if 10 lod money (10 los not),
10 would yive 11 (now). The next two examples transfer the con-
dition 10 the future, and the question as to the fulfilment 01 the
condition is, 01 course, 01 present undecided; hence the uncertainty
01 such conditions being fulfilled is greater than in present con-
ditions. Such conditions may be stated in two ways: the first
form, if 10 01011 1000 money, is used to state 0 supposed future 0000
11 0 (11011001 and oivid manner; the second 10111, if 10 010011 1000
money, is used to state 0 supposed future case in 0 1000 distinct and
oioid manner. We may say is lae-enemo 1000 money, or if 10 should
10υο hod money, the first being used 101 continued action, and the
second (1.0. the perfect) 101 completed action, 10. completed at the
time denoted by the verb 111110 apodosiS, although both forms are
usually rendered in English by the present. The third set 01011-
amples, is 10 tad money, 10 would ywc 11, and if 10 hod 1001 money,
10 would 10υο yioen 11, transfer the conditions to past time, and
hence the time 101 the happening 01 the conditions has already
· passed, ie. they state the supposed case in such 0 manner that we
perceive the condition is unfulfilled, 10. 10 does not 1000 money, ond
does not yiue it. In the first example the imperfect, 0 0111110000, is
used to state the unfulfilment or unreality 01 the condition in present
time. In both sentences the supposed case is represented as unreol,
or contrary to socr, and the conclusion states what would have been
the result 11 the condition had been fulfilled. In Latin, the sub
junctive 10 used in both condition and conclusion,- in the first the
1mperfect, and in the second the pluperfeot. The imperfect refers
